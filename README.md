# GameCube Wireless Controller Hub
The GameCube Wireless Controller hub allows 4 GameCube controllers to be made wireless to any GameCube controller interface. The hub functions in two halves, one to connect to the controllers, and one to connect to the console. Both halves are based on the RP2040 microcontroller and the NRF24l01 transceiver and share the same source code.
